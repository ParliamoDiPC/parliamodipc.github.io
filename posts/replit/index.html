It wasn&rsquo;t much, but it was great. Open a browser, look up repl.it and then replit.com, click create, write some code and boom! Your website was online.</p><p>I recently tried to do that again and was very disappointed in seeing it is not possible anymore. I now apparently need to DEPLOY a project to get the subdomain?? And it COSTS MONEY???
I guess Replit has just become a full-on hosting service for &ldquo;non-sysadmins&rdquo;. I mean, that&rsquo;s not bad at all, I noticed a whole lot of features that did not really exist when I used it and I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re very easy and comfortable to use, but it just feels weird to know I now have to setup apache for 20 minutes on my VPS to create even the smallest of websites.</p><p>I guess that&rsquo;s how it is now.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2024 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
